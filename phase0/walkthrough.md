Suppose player1 inputs a word they want to place, by specifying the start square, direction, and word. Then, the Game class calls dictionary.isValid on the word to check that it is a valid Scrabble word. Then, if it is valid, the player's inputs are passed to board.checkWord to check that the word would fit in the specified position, given the current state of the board. This is done by checking that for every letter of the word overlapping with a nonempty square, the letter matches squares[i][j].getTile().getLetter() where i,j is the coordinates of the square. Finally, the letters from board.lettersNeeded is passed to player1.hasLetters, to check that player1 has the tiles to form the specified word.

After the play is verified to be valid, the required tiles are removed from player1 with player1.removeTile, and these tiles are passed to board.insertWord to be placed. Inside this method, these tiles are assigned to their respective squares using squares[i][j].setTile. The return value of board.insertWord is passed to player1.addPoints to update the player's total. Finally, tiles are repeatedly drawn using bag.drawTile and added to player1 with player1.addTile, until player1.getRackSize() is equal to 7 or the bag is empty.
